This repository demonstrates a common React bug: an infinite loop caused by an incorrectly used useEffect hook. The bug.js file contains the buggy code, while bugSolution.js provides the corrected version.  The issue stems from omitting the dependency array in the useEffect, leading to the effect being executed after every render, creating an infinite render cycle. The solution adds the correct dependency array to resolve this issue.
